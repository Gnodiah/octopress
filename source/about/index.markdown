I’m Henrik Nyh. I was born <span id="birthday">July 26, 1983</span> and live in Stockholm, Sweden with [Johanna](http://johannaost.com).

I currently work as a developer (mostly Ruby on Rails) at [Barsoom](http://barsoom.se/). I have a master’s degree in computational linguistics, though I’ve found I enjoy computers and linguistics more when they’re separate.

I [tweet](http://twitter.com/henrik), [gist](https://gist.github.com/henrik) or [GitHub](http://github.com/henrik) findings and experiences more often than I blog them.

You can reach me at [@henrik](http://twitter.com/henrik) or <henrik@nyh.se>.

I enjoy reading, running, the gym, travel, cooking, baking, photography and pugs, but web development is my main interest. I’m particularly into user interfaces, well-considered flows and delightful touches. I love solving small problems really well.

As for the name, I simply like pugs and automation. Oh, and “pug” sounds vaguely like “blog”.
